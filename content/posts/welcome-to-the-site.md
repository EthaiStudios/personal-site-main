**Welcome to My Portfolio**

Hello and thank you for visiting! I'm Ethan, a Computer Science student at Queen's University Belfast, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

Through the blog section of this site, I'll be posting regular updates about the projects I'm working onâ€”both academic and personal, as well as completed work. As I complete my studies and explore different areas of CS, I hope to give you insight into what I'm learning throughout my First Year at QUB.

Whether you're looking for a chat or wan to discuss anything tech related, my email is always open. I'd love to   hear from you at [Ethan.Allen@visuae.uk](mailto:Ethan.Allen@visuae.uk).

Looking forward to sharing this journey with you all!

Best Wishes, 

Ethan
